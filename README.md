## Introduction

De novo peptide sequencing is crucial for understanding proteomics data, especially when reference genomes are not available. Transnovo is designed to address the challenges in peptide sequencing by employing a state-of-the-art Transformer model, which has proven highly effective in various sequence prediction tasks.

## Features

- **Transformer Architecture**: Utilizes self-attention mechanisms for effective sequence modeling.
- **High Accuracy**: Designed to improve sequencing accuracy with advanced machine learning techniques.
- **Scalable**: Capable of handling large-scale proteomics datasets.
- **Flexible**: Easily adaptable for different types of mass spectrometry data.

## Installation

To get started with Transnovo, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Transnovo.git
cd Transnovo
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Preparing Your Data

Before using Transnovo, ensure your mass spectrometry data is in the correct format. The input should be an MSP file.

### Running the Model

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to run Transnovo for de novo peptide sequencing:

```python
import torch
from transnovo.model import TransnovoModel
from transnovo.data import load_msp_file

# Load data
data = load_msp_file('path_to_your_msp_file.msp.gz')

# Initialize model
model = TransnovoModel()

# Predict peptides
peptides = model.predict(data)

# Print the results
for peptide in peptides:
    print(peptide)
```

## Model Training

To train Transnovo on your own dataset, follow these steps:

1. **Prepare Training Data**: Format your mass spectrometry data as required.
2. **Training Script**: Use the provided training script to train the model.

```bash
python train.py --data_path path_to_training_data --epochs 50 --batch_size 64 --lr 0.001
```

## Inference

For inference, use the pre-trained model or your trained model to sequence new peptides:

```python
python inference.py --model_path path_to_model_checkpoint --data_path path_to_msp_file
```
